		question: "What is something I want to learn or be better at?",
		answer:"Half my family can roll their Rs (i.e. make the trilled-R sound common in romance languages) - guess which half I'm in? I've tried off and on over the years to learn to no avail, and I imagine I'll keep trying for the rest of my life. "

		question: "If I could have a superpower, what would it be?",
		answer:"I have two answers, the practical answer and the instinctual, heart's desire answer. My instinctual answer to this question is 'Shapeshifter'. Given my affinity for animals, it's really no surprise. The practical answer, the one I'd probably choose because the world is the way it is, is 'the ability to refill things'. Out of money? Refill your wallet. Out of gas? Refill your tank. Annoyed by someone? Refill their bladder. The ultimate power for a capitalist society."

		question: "What's something I consider unique about myself?",
		answer:"In academia, I consider myself a 'jack of all trades' scientist, but I feel this label extends to almost every part of my life. Take my education for example: public school, private school, homeschool, community college, public university, and private university. Where I've lived: suburbs outside of Atlanta, inner city Atlanta, middle of nowhere Georgia, whatever you classify Somerville as (it's in the top 20 densest cities in the US but feels like a small town). I've also played a LOT of sports growing up. I'm not a specialist and never will be, but because of my diverse experiences and despite being a classic introverted wallflower, I can almost always find something with which to connect with others, or provide varies perspectives. Diversity is the spice of life."

		question: "What is something I want to learn or be better at?",
		answer:"I'm very analytically-minded, but I'm not very artistic or graphically creative. I rely heavily on inspiration. If I can see something, I can usually reverse-engineer how it was made or works. From there, I tweak and tinker to fit my (or a client's) needs. I believe strongly in improving upon the wheel, not reinventing it, so being a mimic usually works in my favor. That being said, I do want to be a stronger original designer, and that just means more practice."

		question: "Why data visualization?",
		answer:"It combines everything I enjoyed about research and science: exploring data, finding the story, teaching and sharing what I love with others, the diversity of topics you interact with (unlike a phd topic, which is far less variable), and the constant learning and acquisition of skills needed to complete the project. I'm happiest when I'm learning something new or sharing something I just learned with others - and that's the entire point of data visualization. Why wouldn't I want to pursue it as a career?"

		question: "Why study both biology and physics in undergrad?",
		answer:"After taking intro physics I and II at the community college I dual-enrolled in during highschool, I fell in love with the field. So when I applied for college, I did so as an applied physics major. However, even during my first month of my freshman year, I found myself wishing I had more biology in my curriculum. It was during undergrad I realized I was drawn to physics and biology for pretty much the same reason: they helped explain the world - both the animate and the inanimate - around me. I had to do both, forgoing one or the other would have left me filling incomplete."

		question: "Why did I pursue biomechanics in grad school?",
		answer:"I thought biomechanics would be a great way to combine my love of biology and physics, building experimental equipment, and working with animals. I even threw some robotics in there for good measure, just to keep it interesting."

		question: "Can I speak more than one language?",
		answer:"Currently? Eh. I took a year and a half of German in undergrad, and three years Latin in high school. However, since leaving those courses I haven't had many opportunities to keep those skills razor-sharp. Not many people speak Latin conversationally these days, you know?"

			question: "Outside of work, what am I passionate about?",
		answer:"The same passion I have in work - sharing what I love and learn with others - carries on in my hobbies, too. I worked as a rock climbing instructor throughout graduate school and have taught many, many friends how to climb, snowboard, and photograph animals over the years. The high you get from introducing someone you care about to an activity you love - and then they also love it? Amazing."

			question: "What was my first job?",
		answer:"The official answer is, I was a mathematics tutor at Gordon College (now Gordon State College) while I was dual-enrolling there during high-school. The unofficial answer is, I started working as a soccer referee for Lamar County when I was 13 years old - too young to actually be hired by the government, so I was paid under the table. Shh."

	// 	question: "Have I ever worked outside of academia?",
	// 	answer:"Yes, but not in a typical 'industry office' situation. All of these were jobs I held part-time while still in school. I interned at Zoo Atlanta in the bird department during my junior year at Georgia Tech (for class credit), was a freelance tutor for a year, and moonlighted at rock climbing gyms in various positions throughout undergrad and graduate school, but most notably as an Advanced Instructor and part-time route setter (memberships are expensive as a student). I've kept myself fairly busy over the years."
